# MacOS-Autoclicker
This is an Autoclicker that when you run the .app file, it works on mac, but if you run the key.py file it will work on windows. This is a simple project that I have made and is mainly for macOS. DO not expect it to be very good as I am a very beginner-intermediate programmer, and I also don't have a lot of time.


# Beta .1

To use this autoclicker you need to open terminal and downlaod the file named main.py. The navigate to the folder the main.py file is locateed in and then type this command into your terminal     python3 main.py     After you type the command, it will prompt you what to do. If when you try to stop the program and it doesn't stop then just close out the terminal application.
