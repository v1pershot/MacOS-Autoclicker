# MacOS-Autoclicker
This is an Autoclicker that when you run the .app file, it works on mac, but if you run the key.py file it will work on windows. This is a simple project that I have made and is mainly for macOS. DO not expect it to be very good as I am a very beginner-intermediate programmer, and I also don't have a lot of time.
